# Predict_top_Menu_Item_and_Item_Qty
The dataset is for restaurant sales for Friday and Saturday, both at lunch and dinner time. There are few instances of 'To-Go' orders like Uber Eats in this dataset. Typical lunch hour is 11:30 AM-2:00 PM, and dinner hour is 6:30 PM-10:00 PM some of the data is missing so is represented as 'na' in the data set

# Needs to do the following things to run the challenge successfully:
The data set is just for Friday and Saturday. The candidate needs to expand and randomize the data for min. of 6 months (Jan. 2019 to June 2019) for all days of the week.
A typical restaurant has high covers (number of customers) on Friday, Weekend Dinner, followed by Sat/Sun Lunch and then relatively low covers for Monday to Friday Lunch.
The data expansion/randomisation should follow the above pattern for a number of customers.

# The Challenge:
Run min. of 3 different data science models and determine the best model. Provide justification for that model.
Predict top 'Menu Item' and 'Item Qty' for lunch and dinner. These predictions need to be for future dates (Monday to Sunday, July 1st to July 7th)

# Visualization View:
The candidate can best determine the visualization view to clearly outline the predictions.

# Visualization example, just for reference...
