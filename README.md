# Predict_top_Menu_Item_and_Item_Qty
The dataset is for restaurant sales for Friday and Saturday, both at lunch and dinner time. There are few instances of 'To-Go' orders like Uber Eats in this dataset. Typical lunch hour is 11:30 AM-2:00 PM, and dinner hour is 6:30 PM-10:00 PM some of the data is missing so is represented as 'na' in the data set
